Hello All.

We are a group of siblings/friends from Fremont, California reaching out to you with a humble request for your support in helping our cause.

In a crisis like the current Coronavirus that no one has ever faced before, many groups of people have been hit hard, some more than others. We feel strongly  that our duty as a society is to help and support those in need any way we can. These include hospital workers, nursing homes, and homeless shelters. 

Our goal is to create individual kits with supplies customized for each of the above groups including food, masks, goggles and other important items and donate them to local hospitals, nursing homes, and shelters. The supplies are specific to each location and group, with hospitals receiving more medical supplies and shelters receiving more food as an example. We will be calling each of these locations to assess their specific needs and build the kit accordingly.

We will also write motivational and thank you letters to help lift up their spirits and assure them we as a society will get through this together.

Here is a sample kit for our hospital workers.
Hair masks - 5 per kit
Letter for kits- 1 per kit
N-95 Mask /Regular Masks- 5 masks per kit-accounted for
Gloves - 5 pairs per kit
Letter-1 per kit-in progress

We would really appreciate your support in helping us procure the supplies needed for these kits, and also spread the word.

Regards and Thanks
Arnav,Ajay and Anvith !
